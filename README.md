# 3D-segmentation

Repository to temporarily store my spheroid segmentation algorithm.

## Context

Image analysis algorithm to find cell nuclei in confocal image stacks. These are then used to define a connection graph of the spheroid.

## File preparation

The details of the image analysis are customized for our images. The same is true of the file organization. Ours has the following structure:

 -> main folder
 ---> well folder
 -----> time folder
 
 Thus, there are potentially several wells and several time points for each well to analyze. The data is stored accordingly.
 
 ## Use
 
 The best exampe of use is contained in this workflow [notebook](https://github.com/gronteix/3D-segmentation/blob/master/UtilityNotebook.ipynb).
